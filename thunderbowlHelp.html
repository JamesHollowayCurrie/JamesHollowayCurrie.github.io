<h3 class="plainHeading">Thunderbowl FAQ</h3>

<dl class="portfolio">

<dt>Q: Thunderbowl won't start / crashes on load...</dt>
<dd>A: There are a number of things that could be causing the issue. Try the following:
<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
<li>Make sure your system meets the minimum system requirements outlined here.</li>
<li>Upon first launch, Steam should install the Microsoft VC++2017 redistributable. If this did not install correctly (you may have gotten an error to this effect) you can install it from the Microsoft Download Site.</li>
<li>Verify the game files and, if necessary, re-download the game. Right-click the entry in your Steam library and choose "Properties", select the "Local Files" tab and click "Verify Integrity of Game Files". After verification, Steam will notify you if there is a corruption or other issue, and prompt you accordingly.</li>
<li>There may be insufficient memory to load the game's assets, even if your system has the minimum required memory. Try closing any unnecessary applications and then relaunch. This could also be an issue if you are very low (<4GB) on disk space used for virtual memory.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Q: Why doesn't my mouse work on the menu?</dt>
<dd>A: Thunderbowl is designed to work primarily with a gamepad. As such, there is no mouse navigation for the menus. Only the keyboard's arrow and [Enter] keys or P1's gamepad will work. Also note that plugging in a gamepad will disable the in game keyboard controls for P1.</dd>

<dt>Q: How do I make the game run faster (smoother)?</dt>
<dd>A: Thunderbowl is built to run at 60fps at 1080p on the recommended hardware. Try turning down the graphics settings, esp. "Post-Process" and "Particles" for improved performance. Pay attention to the color of the title screen's framerate indicator in the top right corner:
<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
<li>Red = Poor performance. May cause physics and input issues. Turn the graphics settings down.</li>
<li>Orange = Acceptable performance. Should be relatively smooth with minimal frame drops. Keep the "Particles" setting at "med" or "low".</li>
<li>Green = Excellent performance. Crank those settings, just for fun!</li>
</ul>
You can view the framerate in game by holding down the [F] key.

<h3 class="plainHeading">Quick Documentation</h3>
<p class="portfolio">Note: Specific keyboard keys are denoted with [ ]. When using a controller, any UI operation will only respond to P1's controller.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Supported Controllers: </em> Thunderbowl has been built to work with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers for Windows. Other gamepads may work, but the button and stick layouts may vary.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Front Menu:</em> The front menu can be navigated with the arrow keys on the keyboard, or the left control stick / D-Pad on the controller. Pressing [Enter] or start will start the game, unless the "quit" option is selected. All options with arrows next to them indicate they can be modified. The arrows will appear and disapear to indicate their limits.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Adding Players:</em> Thunderbowl will automatically detect the number of compatible controllers and update the "Players" option as they are added and removed. The order they are added is the order of the player assignment. Removing and reconnecting controllers may have undesireable effects on the player assignment. If you find the controllers are not assigned correctly, disconnect them all and then reconnect them in the desired order. If the problem persists, close the game first.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Refresh and Framerate: </em> Thunderbowl automatically scans your display device and caps the framerate at the reported refresh rate. If this is incorrect, close the game, set your display settings to the desired refresh rate, and relaunch.</p>
