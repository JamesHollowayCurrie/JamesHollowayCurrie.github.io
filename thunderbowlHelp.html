<h3 class="subHeading">Quick Documentation</h3>
<p class="portfolio">Note: Specific keyboard keys are denoted with [ ]. When using a controller, any UI operation will only respond to P1's controller.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Front Menu:</em> The front menu can be navigated with the arrow keys on the keyboard, or the left control stick / D-Pad on the controller. Pressing [Enter] or start will start the game, unless the "quit" option is selected. All options with arrows next to them indicate they can be modified. The arrows will appear and disapear to indicate their limits.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Adding Players:</em> Thunderbowl will automatically detect the number of compatible controllers and update the "Players" option as they are added and removed. The order they are added is the order of the player assignment. Removing and reconnecting controllers may have undesireable effects on the player assignment. If you find the controllers are not assigned correctly, disconnect them all and then reconnect them in the desired order. If the problem persists, close the game first.</p>
<p class="portfolio"><em>Refresh and Framerate: </em> Thunderbowl automatically scans your display device and caps the framerate at the reported refresh rate. If this is incorrect, close the game, set your display settings to the desired refresh rate, and relaunch.</p>
